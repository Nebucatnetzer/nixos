Emacs 28 adds M-S-x, a command that restricts executable commands to a curated selection relevant to the current buffer. As it draws from a list of commands with dedicated key bind- ings, or those manually chosen by the mode authors, you may find – as it’s a recent addition – that it’s rather sparse. Nevertheless, I would recommend you make a mental note of it, and use it as another tool in the toolbox to explore Emacs.
