It’s recommended to install the following command-line tools:
fd (a super-fast alternative to find)
ag (a.k.a. the_silver_searcher, a powerful alternative to grep) or rg (a.k.a. ripgrep)
Projectile will make use of them automatically when available, and fallback to the standard Unix tools otherwise.
You should also install the Emacs packages ag, ripgrep or rg if you want to make sure of Projectile’s commands projectile-ag and projectile-ripgrep.
