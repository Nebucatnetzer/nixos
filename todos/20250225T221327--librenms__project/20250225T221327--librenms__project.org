** NEXT Setup Ntfy for notifications

- [[https://community.librenms.org/t/ntfy-transport/27036/4][NTFY Transport - Feature Requests - LibreNMS Community]]

Currently I'm using Telegram for notifications.
This is suboptimal for two reasosns:
1. They are a shitty company
2. Whenever I have to look at the notifications, I have to look at the Telegram messages as well which is quite distracting.

** DONE PING WAN IP
CLOSED: [2025-06-24 Tue 20:39]

** CANCELLED Mobile App einrichten
CLOSED: [2025-06-24 Tue 20:39]

Inlcuding the wrapper

** CANCELLED [[https://beszel.dev/guide/hub-installation#binary][Hub Installation | Beszel]]
CLOSED: [2025-02-23 Sun 14:49]

Beszel doesn't support SNMP at the moment. Since it is a good standard I think I should use it instead of relying on some third party system.

* Notes

*2025-04-28*

I denke ich werde am Zero Hydra Failure event etwas daran weitermachen.
Es ist zwar nicht strickt ZHF aber denke wenn ich die Doku verbessere wird dies schon auch gelten.

** Project overview

I've looked at multiple different projects but LibreNMS seem to be the one that fits the most to what I need.
- Netdata :: Looks like any other open source project but a SaaS company which gives you parts of it and hides the rest behind a paywal and might take away the rest of the functionality as well.
  Requires an agent.
- Grafana+Prometheus :: Goes into a similar direction but has a better track record because it is an older project. However it seems to be quite resource heavy for the host.
- LibreNMS :: Supports SNMP, has auto discovery, is fully open source and has been for a long while. Doesn't use too many resources on the host.
