Ivy / Counsel: Perspective provides two commands for listing buffers using Ivy and Counsel: persp-ivy-switch-buffer and persp-counsel-switch-buffer. When these functions are called normally, they show a list of buffers filtered by the current perspective. With a prefix argument, they shows a list of buffers in all perspectives. The distinction between the ivy and counsel versions is the same as between ivy-switch-buffer and counsel-switch-buffer: the latter shows a preview of the buffer to switch to, and the former does not.
